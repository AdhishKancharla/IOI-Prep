/*
OBSERVATIONS: for each number, denote the first and last occurance of the number. Call this the range of the number.
If we count the number of subarrays so that for all numbers that are present in the subarray, none of them have
their range starting/ending outside, then we are done. This basically means that that number is present inside 
our unit. also note that the sum of elements of such number should be equal to our size of subarray.
